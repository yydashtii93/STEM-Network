# STEM-Network
COMPE561 Final Project

STEM Network Group Project SDSU-FALL2021 

STEM Network is a group project done by Jacob Bananal, Nisma Imroze and myself (Yousef Mohammed) as a requirement for the main project assignment of the COMPE561 course at SDSU. STEM Network is a blog full of articles related to STEM majors; for example, Introduction to C Coding, Web Development, Database Structuring, ..etc

The main purpose of this web app is to share the knowledge with STEM majors' students, which motivates them in building new interests about various subjects and learning about new subjects from articles published by registered users.

Registered users may share their knowledge by posting new articles to the web app, and let students learn from their academic experience.
