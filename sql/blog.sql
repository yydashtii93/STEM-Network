(17, 2, 4, 'Basic Terms and Definitions of Electrical Engineering', '1.Conductors:\r\nConductors are the materials or substances which allow electricity to flow through them. They conduct electricity because they allow electrons to flow easily inside them from atom to atom. Also, conductors allow the transmission of heat or light from one source to another.\r\nMetals, humans, earth, and animals are all conductors. This is the reason we get electric shocks! Moreover, the human body is a good conductor. So, it provides a resistance-free path for the current to flow from wire to body.\r\nConductors have free electrons on its surface which allow current to pass through easily. This is the reason why conductors can conduct electricity.\r\nExamples pf Conductors:\r\n•	Material such as silver is the best conductor of electricity. But it is costly and     so, we don’t use silver in industries and transmission of electricity.\r\n•	Copper, Brass, Steel, Gold, and Aluminum are good conductors of electricity. We use them in electric circuits and systems in the form of wires.\r\n•	Mercury is an excellent liquid conductor. Thus, this material finds use in many instruments.\r\n•	Gases are not good conductors of electricity because the atoms are quite far away. Thus, they are unable to conduct electrons.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.Insulators:\r\nInsulators are the materials or substances which resist or don’t allow the current to flow through them. In general, they are solid in nature. They do not allow the flow of heat. The property which makes insulators different from conductors is its resistivity.\r\nWood, cloth, glass, mica, and quartz are some good examples of insulators. Also, insulators are protectors. They give protection against heat, sound and of course passage of electricity. Furthermore, insulators don’t have any free electrons. It is the main reason why they don’t conduct electricity.\r\nExamples of Insulators:\r\n•	Glass is the best insulator as it has the highest resistivity.\r\n•	Plastic is a good insulator, and it finds its use in making several things.\r\n•	Rubber is a common material used in making tires, fire-resistant clothes and slippers. This is because it is a very good insulator.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.Resistors:\r\nThe resistor is a passive electrical component that creates resistance in the flow of electric current. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses. In almost all electrical networks and electronic circuits they can be found. The resistance is measured in ohms (Ω). \r\nThey are commercially available with resistance values over a range of more than nine orders of magnitude. They can be used as electric brakes to dissipate kinetic energy from trains or be smaller than a square millimeter for electronics.\r\n\r\n4.Capacitor:\r\nCapacitor is a device for storing electrical energy, consisting of two conductors in proximity and insulated from each other.\r\nCapacitors have many important applications. They are used, for example, in digital circuits so that information stored in large computer memories is not lost during a momentary electric power failure; the electric energy stored in such capacitors maintains the information during the temporary loss of power. Capacitors play an even more important role as filters to divert spurious electric signals and thereby prevent damage to sensitive components and circuits caused by electric surges.\r\n\r\n5.Voltage:\r\nVoltage (also known as electric potential difference, electromotive force emf, electric pressure, or electric tension) is defined as the electric potential difference per unit charge between two points in an electric field. Voltage is expressed mathematically (e.g., in formulas) using the symbol “V” or “E”.\r\nIn a static electric field, the work required to move per unit of charge between two points is known as voltage. \r\n\r\n6.Current:\r\nA flow of positive electric charge. The strength of current flow in any medium is related to voltage differences in that medium, as well as the electrical properties of the medium, and is measured in amperes. Since electrons are stipulated to have a negative charge, current in an electrical circuit flow in the opposite direction of the movement of electrons. ', 'basics of EE.png', '2021-12-07'),

This is true for many materials (including metals) provided the temperature (and other physical factors) remain constant. The constant of proportionality R, R is the resistance, and the unit is the ohm, with symbol Omega, Ω. The relationship can be written as:\r\n\r\n                                                      V=IR\r\nwhere V, V is the voltage across the conductor and I, I is the current flowing through it. If a component is ohmic (it obeys Ohm\'s Law), then its resistance must be independent of current and voltage.\r\nOhm\'s law is very important. One example of its use involves power.\r\nFor a component that has a current I, I running though it and voltage V,V across it, the power dissipated in that component is P, equals, V, I,P=VI. This can be rewritten as P=V^2/R and P=I^2R\r\nIf the component obeys Ohm\'s law, R, R will be constant, and so the power will be proportional to V^2 and I^2\r\nOhm\'s Law is one of the most fundamental and important laws governing electrical and electronic circuits. It relates relates current, voltage and resistance for a linear device, such that if two are known, the third can be calculated.\r\nWith current, voltage and resistance being three of the major circuit quantities, this means that Ohm\'s Law is also immensely important.\r\nOhm\'s Law is used within all branches of electrical and electronic science. It is used for calculating the value of resistors required in circuits, and it can also be used for determining the current flowing in a circuit where the voltage can be measured easily across a known resistor, but more than this, Ohm\'s Law is used in a vast number of calculations in all forms of electrical and electronic circuit- in fact anywhere that current flows.', 'Ohm-law-triangle-v2.jpg', '2021-12-07'),
(19, 2, 4, 'Kirchhoff\'s Law', 'Coulomb force, also called electrostatic force or Coulomb interaction, attraction or repulsion of particles or objects because of their electric charge One of the basic physical forces, the electric force is named for a French physicist, Charles Augustin de Coulombs, who in 1785 published the results of an experimental investigation into the correct quantitative description of this force.\r\nTwo like electric charges, both positive or both negative, repel each other along a straight line between their centers. \r\n\r\nTwo unlike charges, one positive, one negative, attract each other along a straight line joining their centers. The electric force is operative between charges down to distances of at least 10-16 meter, or approximately one-tenth of the diameter of atomic nuclei. Because of their positive charge, protons within nuclei repel each other, but nuclei hold together because of another basic physical force, the strong interaction, or nuclear force which is stronger than the electric force. Massive, but electrically neutral, astronomical bodies such as planets and stars are bound together in solar systems and galaxies by still another basic physical force, gravitation, which though much weaker than the electric force, is always attractive and is the dominant force at great distances. At distances between these extremes, including the distances of everyday life, the only significant physical force is the electric force in its many varieties along with the related magnetic force.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of the electric force F is directly proportional to the amount of one electric charge, q1, multiplied by the other, q2, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance r between their centers. Expressed in the form of an equation, this relation, called Coulomb’s Law, may be written by including the proportionality factor k as F = kq1q2/r2. In the centimeter–gram–second system of units, the proportionality factor k in a vacuum is set equal to 1 and unit electric charge is defined by Coulomb’s law. If an electric force of one unit (one dyne) arises between two equal electric charges one centimeter apart in a vacuum, the amount of each charge is one electrostatic unit, esu, or stat coulomb. In the meter–kilogram–second and the SI systems, the unit of force (newton), the unit of charge (coulomb), and the unit of distance (meter), are all defined independently of Coulomb’s law, so the proportionality factor k is constrained to take a value consistent with these definitions, namely, k in a vacuum equals 8.98 × 109 newton square meter per square coulomb. This choice of value for k permits the practical electrical units, such as ampere and volt, to be included with the common metric mechanical units, such as meter and kilogram, in the same system.', 'Kirchhoffs-Laws-Featured-Image.jpg', '2021-12-07'),

The fluid is almost always oil of some sort. The force is almost always multiplied in the process. For example, the blade of a bulldozer is normally operated by hydraulic power.\r\nThe simplest hydraulic system consists of a pair of cylinders with moveable pistons in each and the whole system filled with a fluid. Push one piston in and the other moves out.\r\nIf the area of the input piston and the output piston are the same then the forces will be the same. The pressure of the hydraulic fluid is the same throughout the machine and equal to force divided by area. If the pistons have the same surface area there will be the same force acting on them.\r\n•	An output piston with a larger area has more force acting on it by the fluid.\r\n•	An output piston with a smaller area has less force acting on it by the fluid.\r\n•	In other words, a hydraulic machine can produce a large force by simply having a larger area output cylinder and piston.\r\n•	Seen in this way, there are clear parallels between hydraulic machines and simple levers.\r\nDesigning hydraulic machines\r\n•	Designing hydraulic machines involves choosing the relative areas of the pistons in just the same way that the design of levers involves choosing the relative lengths of the line of action of the forces from the pivot point.\r\n•	Being able to tap into the pressure in the fluid at any point makes hydraulic machines quite simple to engineer. You can easily design a machine that exerts an output force of some fixed size compared to the input force, at any angle you choose.\r\n•	You can also easily have the same effect in two different places, simply by creating two pistons of equal cross-sectional area. This can be used, for example, to exert equal braking forces on all four wheels of a car.\r\n•	Producing a big force by providing a large area output piston seems to be too good to be true. There must be a catch! The downside is that the output piston which exerts the large force cannot move very far (compared to the input piston). It\'s just like a lever.\r\nFor example:\r\nIf the output piston has four times the area of the input piston and the output force is therefore four times the input force, then the output piston will move only one quarter the distance of the input piston.', 'hydraulic.jpg', '2021-12-07'),
(25, 3, 5, 'Thermodynamics', 'Thermodynamics is a science of the relationship between heat, work, temperature and energy. In broad terms, thermodynamics deals with the transfer of energy from one place to another and from one form to another. The key concept is that heat is a form of energy corresponding to a definite amount of mechanical work.\r\nThe most important laws of thermodynamics are:\r\n•	The zeroth law of thermodynamics. When two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, the first two systems are in thermal equilibrium with each other. This property makes it meaningful to use thermometers as the “third system” and to define a temperature scale.\r\n•	The first law of thermodynamics, or the law of conservation of energy. The change in a system’s internal energy is equal to the difference between heat added to the system from its surroundings and work done by the system on its surroundings.\r\n•	The second law of thermodynamics. Heat does not flow spontaneously from a colder region to a hotter region, or, equivalently, heat at a given temperature cannot be converted entirely into work. Consequently, the entropy of a closed system, or heat energy per unit temperature, increases over time toward some maximum value. Thus, all closed systems tend toward an equilibrium state in which entropy is at a maximum and no energy is available to do useful work.\r\n•	The third law of thermodynamics. The entropy of a perfect crystal of an element in its most stable form tends to zero as the temperature approaches absolute zero. This allows an absolute scale for entropy to be established that, from a statistical point of view, determines the degree of randomness or disorder in a system.\r\nAlthough thermodynamics developed rapidly during the 19th century in response to the need to optimize the performance of steam engines, the sweeping generality of the laws of thermodynamics makes them applicable to all physical and biological systems.

An important component of Geomatics is Geographic Information Systems (GIS); GIS uses spatial data to explore geographic phenomena. GIS includes communicating and visualizing spatial data; these aspects of GIS are commonly (and historically) associated with the field of cartography (the art and science of map making).\r\nIn addition to Geomatics, GIS, and Cartography, some of the topics that will be covered include:\r\nGeodesy: The study of Earth’s size and shape, one goal of which is the definition of geodetic datums (models of Earth size and shape).\r\nRemote Sensing &amp; Aerial Photography: Making physical observations without direct contact or touch; aerial photography is limited to those observations made with photographic technology, while remote sensing is often associated with digital images, although the two share many common concepts and methods.\r\nGlobal Position System (GPS): A system composed of earth orbiting satellites that produce accurate time signals that are used to determine precise and accurate location on Earth’s surface using a mathematical technique called trilateration (not to be confused with triangulation). \r\nGeographic Information Science: The study and extension of GIS capabilities. While this topic emerged in the 1990s, GIS could not exist without the various advances in what we know about Earth as an object of study, how to systematically simplify it, and how we might examine the patterns that emerge from presenting reality using models (simplified representations).\r\nGeographic Information Systems exist as a tool for geographic exploration and investigation. GIS support a digital representation of geography and as such rely on aspects of data, databases, computation, and abstraction. Because their essence is digital, GIS representations have difficulty portraying aspects of reality that cannot be measured or assigned a value. This includes emotions, feelings, or other qualitatively assessed phenomena. In portraying geography digitally, GIS relies on storing information as data. GIS data generally falls first into two categories: Spatial and Non-Spatial data. Spatial data provides the spatial structure to which non-spatial data is assigned. The spatial structure must accommodate both geography (political units, physical features, locations, roads, cities, etc.) and cartography (be something that can be “drawn,” such as points, lines, and areas). If a line represents a road, and a string of Latitude and Longitude coordinates define the line’s position and extent, then the combination of spatial data (string of coordinates) and non-spatial data (categorized as road) makes it geographic information.', 'geomatics.jpg', '2021-12-07'),

Statistics is a fundamental tool of data scientists, who are expected to gather and analyze large amounts of structured and unstructured data and report on their findings. Following are the two main statistical methods used in data analytics:\r\n•	Descriptive statistics\r\nIt is the process of using and analyzing the quantitatively describes or summarizes features from a collection of information. These summaries form the idea of the initial description of the info as a part of a more extensive statistical analysis.\r\n•	Inferential statistics\r\nStatistical inference is that the process of using data analysis to infer properties of an underlying distribution of probability. Inferential statistical analysis speculates properties of a population. It is assumed that the observed data set is sampled from a bigger population. In machine learning, the term inference means to make a prediction, by evaluating an already trained model.\r\nAnalytics:\r\nAnalytics is the process of extraction of meaningful patterns in data. Core computer programming, statistics and machine learning are the concrete base for Analytics, to provide quantifiable performance and prediction. Analytics results in data visualization of trends and metrics to communicate insight. Firms may commonly apply analytics to business data to explain, predict, and improve business performance. Specifically, arenas within analytics include predictive analytics, enterprise decision management, retail analytics, web analytics, sales department sizing and optimization, price and promotion modeling, credit risk analysis, and fraud analytics. Analytics requires extensive computation and statistics for their algorithms to produce trends.\r\n\r\nTypes of Data Analytics.\r\nFour basic types of data analytics.\r\n1. Descriptive analytics is the evaluation over a given period. What is the rating of channel this week? Does it increase? Are the sales pump up with new marketing strategy this month?\r\n2. Diagnostic analytics investigate the cause of change. This requires hypothesizing heterogeneous data. How weather affect the clothing series? Did the sales pump up with new marketing strategy?\r\n3. Predictive analytics forecasts what could be happen in near time. What was happened last time when we overdue client? How many t-shirts sale in winter this year?\r\n4. Prescriptive analytics suggests a set of actions and measures. if the summer weather How weather expends for more than 4 months, we have to increase the production of t-shirts this summer.\r\nStatistics in Data Analytics\r\nIn Analytics assumptions are made upon the trends and predictions are made relying upon the statistics. Statistics focuses on analyzing, collecting, and interpreting data in a logical and usually numerical way, it makes sense that the techniques developed in Statistics are directly useful within Data Analytics.

(29, 5, 5, 'Optimization', 'Optimization, also known as mathematical programming, collection of mathematical principles and methods used for solving quantitative problems in many disciplines including physics, biology, engineering, economics, and business. The subject grew from a realization that quantitative problems in manifestly different disciplines have important mathematical elements in common. Because of this commonality, many problems can be formulated and solved by using the\r\nunified set of ideas and methods that make up the field of optimization.\r\nOptimization problems typically have three fundamental elements. The first is a single numerical quantity, or objective function, that is to be maximized or minimized. The objective may be the expected return on a stock portfolio, a company’s production costs or profits, the time of arrival of a vehicle at a specified destination, or the vote share of a political candidate. The second element is a collection of variables, which are quantities whose values can be manipulated in order to optimize the objective. Examples include the quantities of stock to be bought or sold, the amounts of various resources to be allocated to different production activities, the route to be followed by a vehicle through a traffic network, or the policies to be advocated by a candidate. The third element of an optimization problem is a set of constraints, which are restrictions on the values that the variables can take. For instance, a manufacturing process cannot require more resources than are available, nor can it employ less than zero\r\nresources. Within this broad framework, optimization problems can have different mathematical properties. Problems in which the variables are continuous quantities (as in the resource allocation example) require a different approach from problems in which the variables are discrete or combinatorial quantities (as in the selection of a vehicle route from among a predefined set of possibilities).\r\n\r\nAn important class of optimization is known as linear programming .Linear  programming indicates that no variables are raised to higher powers, such as squares. For this class, the problems involve minimizing (or maximizing) a linear objective function whose variables are real numbers that are constrained to satisfy a system of linear equalities and inequalities.\r\n\r\nAnother important class of optimization is known as nonlinear programming. In nonlinear programming the variables are real numbers, and the objective or some of the constraints are nonlinear functions (possibly involving squares, square roots, trigonometric functions, or products of the variables). \r\n', 'optimization.jpeg', '2021-12-07'),
(30, 5, 5, 'Modeling and Simulation', 'Modeling:\r\n\r\nModeling is the process of producing a model; a model is a representation of the construction and working of some system of interest. A model is similar to but simpler than the system it represents. One purpose of a model is to enable the analyst to predict the effect of changes to the system. On the one hand, a model should be a close approximation to the real system and incorporate most of its salient features. On the other hand, it should not be so complex that it is impossible to understand and experiment with it. A good model is a judicious tradeoff between realism and simplicity. Simulation practitioners recommend increasing the complexity of a model iteratively. An important issue in modeling is model validity. Model validation techniques include simulating the model under known input conditions and comparing model output with system output.\r\n\r\nGenerally, a model intended for a simulation study is a mathematical model developed with the help of simulation software. Mathematical model classifications include deterministic (input and output variables are fixed values) or stochastic (at least one of the input or output variables is probabilistic); static (time is not considered) or dynamic (time-varying interactions among variables are considered). Typically, simulation models are stochastic and dynamic.\r\n\r\nSimulation:\r\n\r\nA simulation of a system is the operation of a model of the system. The model can be reconfigured and experimented with; usually, this is impossible, too expensive or impractical to do in the system it represents. The operation of the model can be studied, and hence, properties concerning the behavior of the actual system, or its subsystem can be inferred. In its broadest sense, simulation is a tool to evaluate the performance of a system, existing or proposed, under different configurations of interest and over long periods of real time. \r\n\r\nSimulation is used before an existing system is altered or a new system built, to reduce the chances of failure to meet specifications, to eliminate unforeseen bottlenecks, to prevent under or over-utilization of resources, and to optimize system performance. For instance, simulation can be used to answer questions like: What is the best design for a new telecommunications network? What are the associated resource requirements? How will a telecommunication network perform when the traffic load increases by 50%? How will a new routing algorithm affect its performance? Which network protocol optimizes network performance? What will be the impact of a link failure?\r\n\r\nThe subject is discrete event simulation in which the central assumption is that the system changes instantaneously in response to certain discrete events. For instance, in an M/M/1 queue - a single server queuing process in which time between arrivals and service time are exponential - an arrival causes the system to change instantaneously. On the other hand, continuous simulators, like flight simulators and weather simulators, attempt to quantify the changes in a system continuously over time in response to controls. Discrete event simulation is less detailed (coarser in its smallest time unit) than continuous simulation, but it is much simpler to implement, and hence, is used in a wide variety of situations.', 'modeling.png', '2021-12-07'),

Node.js was created when the original developers of JavaScript expanded it from something that could only be run in the browser to something that could be run as a standalone application on your machine. JavaScript can now perform tasks that other scripting languages, such as Python, can perform. V8 JavaScript runtime engine powers both your browser\'s JavaScript and Node.js. This engine converts JavaScript code to faster machine code. Machine code is low-level code that the computer can execute without first interpreting.\r\n\r\n      Therefore, people choose Node.js due to its lightweight and efficiency because it employs an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. In addition, there are two lines that make Node.js so popular, which is the blocking I/O and the non-blocking I/O. The Blocking I/O is where user2’s data request does not begin until user1\'s data is displayed on the screen. However, if this were a web server, we would have to create a new thread for each new user. But JavaScript is single-threaded (well, not really, but it has a single-threaded event loop, which we\'ll go over later). As a result, JavaScript is not ideal for multi-threaded tasks. This is where the non-blocking comes into play. Therefore, non-blocking I/O can start a data request for user2 without waiting for the response to user1\'s request. Both requests can be started at the same time.\r\n\r\n      Finally, there are libraries created by the amazing community that will solve the majority of your generic problems. You can use npm (Node package manager) packages in your apps to make development faster and more efficient.', 'Node.js', '2021-12-07');

For applications such as motor drives, power output in the kilowatt range is now required. This, together with current module space constraints, means that the need for more power is being passed on to components, specifically MOSFETs. To get the best performance out of power MOSFETs and maintain device reliability over the required operating life, careful consideration of design requirements and understanding of maximum ratings in circuit design are required.\r\n\r\n      The gate, source, and drain terminals of the MOSFET are all connected together.
